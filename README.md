 # Aviation Safety Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from the NTSB (1982-2022) to provide strategic recommendations for a new business entering the aviation market. The goal is to identify the safest aircraft types, manufacturers, and operational protocols to minimize risk.

## Repository Contents
* **`Aviation_Safety_Analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.
* **`AviationData_Cleaned.csv`**: The processed dataset ready for Tableau visualization.
* **`Aviation_Safety_Presentation.pptx`**: A summary presentation of findings and business recommendations.
* **`Images/`**: Folder containing the generated charts used in the presentation.

## Key Findings
1.  **Safety by Make**: Cessna aircraft show a lower fatality rate (17%) compared to similar light aircraft like Beechcraft (29%).
2.  **Engine Reliability**: Turbo-fan and Turbo-prop engines have significantly fewer accidents than reciprocating piston engines.
3.  **Critical Phases**: The majority of accidents occur during Takeoff and Landing, necessitating focused pilot training.

## Visualizations
This project uses **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for static analysis and **Tableau** for interactive dashboards.
